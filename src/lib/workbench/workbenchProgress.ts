// THE RUN, WHILE IT IS STILL RUNNING.
//
// The Workbench used to be binary: empty until the run finished, then fully
// populated. A five-minute sourcing run therefore looked identical to a hung one
// — which is how TEST task c8a6e53d went unnoticed while the plan sat in Running
// forever.
//
// run-agent's capability engine now publishes a snapshot after each stage into
// `tasks.result.workbench_progress`. This module turns one of those snapshots
// into display lines.
//
// THE RULE THAT MAKES IT SAFE. Nothing here can report a company as QUALIFIED.
// The engine sets `qualified_companies` only from an explicit Company Brain
// verdict, and this module only ever reads it — it never derives a qualification
// from "we found some accounts". A mid-run row that looks qualified is the exact
// fail-open the persistence-authority work was for.
//
// PURE. No React, no network, no database.
