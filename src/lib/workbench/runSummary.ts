// ONE SET OF HEADLINE NUMBERS FOR THE WORKBENCH.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPLACES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three counter systems rendered at once, above the leads:
//
//   PortfolioSummary        11 cells  Requested, Shown, Opportunities,
//                                     Tier A/B/C, Qualified, Review, Watch,
//                                     Contact-ready
//   WorkflowProgressStrip    7 lines  Accounts found, Evaluated, Open roles
//                                     read, Eligible opportunities, Verified
//                                     companies, Qualified companies,
//                                     Decision-makers verified
//   LeadResultsView chips    6 chips  ACCOUNTS FOUND, EVALUATED, QUALIFIED
//                                     COMPANIES, DECISION-MAKERS VERIFIED,
//                                     CONTACT-READY, REMAINING
//
// Twenty-four numbers. "Qualified" appeared THREE times, and Accounts found,
// Evaluated, Contact-ready and Decision-makers verified each appeared twice.
//
// ── AND THEY COULD DISAGREE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Not merely repetitive — they read three different persisted projections of
// the same fact: the engine's quota contract, the portfolio the engine built,
// and the row-level table. A user seeing "Qualified 3" beside "Qualified
// companies 6" has no way to know which is the answer, and neither did the UI:
// nothing compared them.
//
// So this does two things. It picks ONE authority per number, using the same
// precedence `buildWorkbenchCounts` already established — the engine's own
// answer beats a projection, a projection beats counting rows. And it RECORDS
// any disagreement instead of silently preferring one, because two projections
// of one run disagreeing is a data defect, and hiding it behind a chosen winner
// is how it would survive.
//
// ── WHY `qualified` IS NOT `!not_qualified` ─────────────────────────────────
//
// `qualification.ts` carries the scar: TEST plan edb4cbf6 reported 20 qualified
// companies for a run whose qualified set was empty, because the count asked
// "was this rejected?" instead of "was this accepted?". Absence of a rejection
// is not a pass. Every count here reads an explicit positive verdict.
//
// Pure — no React, no network.
