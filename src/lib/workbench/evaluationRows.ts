// EVALUATED COMPANIES — visible, explained, and never actionable.
//
// TEST task 42e39fb1 shortlisted six companies with real commercial hiring
// signals inside the size range, resolved none of their LinkedIn identities, and
// showed the user an empty Workbench. The work was done and invisible.
//
// These rows fix the visibility WITHOUT reopening the fail-open hole. They come
// from `tasks.result.workbench_evaluation_rows`, they carry NO
// `lead_candidate_id`, and every action in the product requires one — so they
// cannot be selected, enriched, drafted against, or fed to a paid people search.
// The impossibility is structural, not a rule someone has to remember.
//
// ── AND NOT EVERY ROW HERE IS A REJECTION ────────────────────────────────────
//
// This table was captioned "evaluated but NOT QUALIFIED" for every row it
// received, including companies the run never spent a cent on. The backend
// projection now distinguishes a judged rejection from a company that was
// deferred by the clock, held for missing evidence, or never investigated at
// all — and `decided` carries that distinction onto each row so this side never
// has to guess it.
//
// READ DEFENSIVELY. A task written by an older build has none of the new fields.
// Such a row degrades to `decided: false` — the safe direction, because the
// failure mode being fixed is calling something a rejection when it is not.
//
// PURE. No React, no network, no database.
