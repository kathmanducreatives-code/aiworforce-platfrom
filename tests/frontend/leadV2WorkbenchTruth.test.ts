// LEAD V2 RUN 4250f181 — THE WORKBENCH SAID "10 REVIEWED / 8 RULED OUT".
//
// The truth: 33 discovered across five attempts, 20 triaged out, 8 still
// waiting on identity resolution, none verified, none qualified — and not one
// company ruled out on fit. Eight identity_unresolved rows carried a note from
// the free prequalification pass (`insufficient_commercial`, `technical_only`),
// and that note alone sent them to "Ruled out".
//
// PURE.
