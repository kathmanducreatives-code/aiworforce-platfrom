// THE CANONICAL MISSION VIEW IS THE AUTHORITY FOR THE RUN SUMMARY WHENEVER IT EXISTS.
//
// Production Salvo, plan ce80738e / task 8455db21 (2026-09-26): one known
// company, funding verified, qualified, one Lead Library row, run_outcome
// canonical qualified = 1, SATISFIED — and the Workbench footer said "counts
// disagree". The summary chose its path by asking whether any EVALUATION ROW
// carried a canonical decision; a company that qualifies is a lead row, so a
// run whose every company qualified has none, and the summary fell back to
// reconciling the stored `workbench_portfolio` (written by the engine BEFORE
// the funding verifier ran: qualified 0) against the lead.
//
// The values below are the production task's stored fields, verbatim where
// the summary reads them.
//
// Pure. No React, no network.
