// LEAD V2 REPLAY LAB — ONE ENGINE SLICE, OFFLINE.
//
// Runs the production `runCapabilityPlan` (discovery, identity, enrichment,
// triage, qualification, persistence records) with:
//
//   provider calls  → FixtureProvider (strict; recorded answers only)
//   model calls     → the fixture's recorded model outputs (planner, discovery
//                     selector, mission evaluator) — deterministic
//
// Everything else is the engine as production runs it, including the P2 spec
// spine (`specMode: "enforce"`) that compiles every provider call and reserves
// it against the ledger before the provider is reached.
