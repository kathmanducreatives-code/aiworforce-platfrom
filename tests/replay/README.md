# Lead V2 Replay Lab

A production bug should only need to happen once. After that, its execution
state is a deterministic fixture replayed offline — zero provider calls, zero
credits, zero production writes — through the **same production functions**
Lead V2 runs.

```bash
npm run test:lead-v2-readiness
```

```
Golden missions:                 PASS  (6/6)
Historical regression replays:   PASS  (17/17)
Claim/evidence invariants:       PASS  (6/6)
Provider-spec invariants:        PASS  (5/5)
Budget invariants:               PASS  (2/2)
Continuation invariants:         PASS  (2/2)
Fixtures sanitized:              PASS  (6 fixtures)

SAFE FOR PRODUCTION SMOKE: YES
```

The tests run with `--allow-read --allow-env` only: a network call is a
permission error, not a silent purchase. CI runs the same command
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, "Lead V2 readiness").

## Architecture

| Layer | Production | Replay |
|---|---|---|
| Spec compile | `compileProviderCallSpec` / `verifierSpecCompiler` | same |
| Readiness, guard | `routeReadiness`, `guardedInvoker` | same |
| Budget | `reserve` / `previewReserve`, `missionSpendCap` | same |
| **Network** | `capabilityInvoke` → Apify / Firecrawl | **`FixtureProvider.invoke`** (strict) |
| Normalizers → observations → claims → eligibility | engine + `candidateEligibility` | same |
| Verifiers | `runClaimVerificationPhase` + `ledgerBoundCall` + `ledgerPreflight` | same |
| Model calls | planner, selector, evaluator, triage, reasoner | recorded outputs (`model_responses`) |
| Canonical view | `buildWorkbenchMissionView` | same |
| Continuation | `foldSlice`, `decideAutoContinuation`, `settleV2Outcome` | same |
| Queue | Postgres functions + worker core + `releaseQueuedMission` | same SQL in PGlite + same worker core |
| Checkpoint | `toResumeRecord` / `restoreWorkingSet` | same |

`lib/`
- `fixture.ts` — schema, loader, sanitization guard (credential/email shapes refuse to load)
- `provider.ts` — `FixtureProvider` (match by candidate keys, input fields or input hash; per-company row selection; `pending_once` runs adopted later) and `noNetwork()`
- `state.ts` — the ledger **as of an instant** (reservations timed by their `lead_execution_calls` rows) and companies via `restoreWorkingSet`
- `verification.ts` — checkpoint replay of the verification phase wired exactly as run-agent's `verifierDepsFor`; `canonicalView`
- `engine.ts` — one `runCapabilityPlan` slice with recorded model outputs
- `mission.ts` — whole golden missions: engine → verifiers → checkpoint → view → continuation → real queue SQL
- `continuation.ts` — a canary's logged slice counters through `foldSlice` + `decideAutoContinuation`
- `queue.ts` — PGlite running the production queue migrations, the production worker core and release

## Checkpoint replay

`replayVerificationAt(fixture, "before_hiring_verification:slice1")` rebuilds the
state at that instant — the ledger from reservations written before it, the
companies from the checkpoint records trimmed to it — and runs only the
downstream phase. Each fixture's **anchors** (figures production logged at that
instant, e.g. LlamaIndex's $0.0098 evidence spend) are asserted first, so a
reconstruction that drifted from production fails before any expectation is read.

## Historical fixtures

| | Canary | Bug | Data |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | 98ce374b | pool counted "enough"; page 2 never bought | stored mission + logged shape (task row gone) |
| B | 9230df70 | verifier-only slices counted barren | logged counters (task row gone) |
| C | 53784493 | clean continuations spent retries; slice 6 never claimed | logged counters, real queue SQL |
| D | 3f945ff4 (Canary 6) | budget hard stop | production ledger, refusals to the cent |
| E | 154541e8 / c01d28d8 | NON_EQUITY_ASSISTANCE counted as funding | LlamaIndex's production Atomus record |
| F | c01d28d8 (Canary 8) | affordability priced raw ($0.121) vs reserved ($0.049) | production checkpoint, ledger, mission |

Each fixture lists its sources and sanitization in `provenance`; extraction
queries live in `fixtures/queries/` (read-only).

## Adding a fixture after a production bug

1. Extract read-only (see `fixtures/queries/canary8.sql`): mission, ledger
   reservations + their call timestamps, the checkpoint records, the events.
2. Trim records to the decision instant; restore in-flight runs as `verifier_pending_runs`.
3. Record the logged figures as `anchors` and assert them first.
4. Write the expectation against the corrected behaviour; mutation-check it
   against the bug (the test must fail with the bug reintroduced).
5. Tag tests `[historical]` (or `[claims]`, `[budget]`, …) so the readiness report counts them.

## Gaps

- **run-agent's end-of-slice orchestration is inline.** The lab mirrors its
  continuation-input assembly with the same production building blocks and a
  source-pin test (`invariants/providerSpec.test.ts`) fails if run-agent's
  wiring changes; extracting it into a shared function would remove the mirror.
- **Not replayed:** run-agent's funding pool screen, model triage and reasoner
  (their outputs are recorded, not re-derived), Apify receipt settlement (spend
  is held at the provisional/estimate), and every Supabase write.
- **Model outputs are recorded, not regenerated** — a prompt change is not
  exercised by replay.
- **Fixtures A and B** use the logged counters/shape: their task rows are no
  longer in production.
- Known gap test: the funding evidence headline names the NEA event (display only).
