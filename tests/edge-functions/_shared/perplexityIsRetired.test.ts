// PERPLEXITY MUST NOT BE REACHABLE FROM PRODUCTION.
//
// ── WHY IT WAS REMOVED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `research_web` called `api.perplexity.ai` directly from `toolRegistry`,
// outside `aiProvider` and `gptProvider` — the only two seams that reach
// `ModelCallCollector`. So it was:
//
//     live         13 calls, the last on 2026-08-31
//     uncaptured   no row in `lead_model_calls`, no tokens, no cost
//     unmetered    absent from `PAID_TOOLS`, so no credit reservation either
//
// One production path that could spend money without appearing in ANY of the
// three accounting systems. Rather than wire a fourth provider into the ledger
// and the two spend ceilings, it is retired until something needs it.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE GUARDS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The executor was deleted, not flagged off, so the guarantee is structural: a
// `fetch` that does not exist cannot be re-enabled by configuration. This test
// keeps it that way, and fails if a Perplexity call site reappears anywhere in
// `supabase/functions` without being added to the allow-list below with a
// reason.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO models, ZERO providers, ZERO database.
