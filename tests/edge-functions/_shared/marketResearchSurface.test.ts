// A MARKET IS A TOPIC, AND A CAPABILITY IS A QUESTION YOU ASK.
//
// ── TWO DEFECTS, ONE SURFACE ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The vocabulary had no word for a topic. "What's happening in AI recruiting?"
// names no company and no page, so it had nowhere to land but the lead
// pipeline — which would read the topic words as a description of companies to
// go and find, buying a discovery run for a question that asked for none.
//
// And availability was INFERRED. pilot-chat decided this surface was degraded by
// testing `!decision.selected_actor_key` — a field the classifier deliberately
// leaves unset so `validateAgainstCapabilities` can fill or clear it. Three
// components had to agree on the meaning of one null for the user to be told the
// truth, and the question underneath was never semantic: is web search
// configured in this deployment?
