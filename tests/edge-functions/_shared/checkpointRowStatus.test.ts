// A CHECKPOINT IS A COMPLETE RECORD, OR IT IS A STUCK ROW.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS REPRODUCES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Task 5c461aa3, 2026-08-28 16:36. The first run to complete real provider
// work: `harvestapi/linkedin-company-search` returned 30 companies,
// `harvestapi/linkedin-company` enriched 4, and the engine checkpointed at the
// stage boundary — 30 discovered, 10 shortlisted, 2 credits charged.
//
// The hiring search then started (`nyjSdju8xF7IEcgoc`), ran 116 seconds, and
// SUCCEEDED with 74 job items. The edge function's wall clock expired at ~186s
// and the platform killed the isolate mid-poll.
//
// The checkpoint had written `result` and nothing else. `tasks.status` stayed
// `running` forever, so the execution card spun; the terminal guard that exists
// to prevent exactly this could not help, because its `finally` does not run
// when an isolate is hard-killed. And because the row never became resumable,
// the ledger-based pending-run recovery — which already exists and would have
// adopted that finished dataset — was never reached.
