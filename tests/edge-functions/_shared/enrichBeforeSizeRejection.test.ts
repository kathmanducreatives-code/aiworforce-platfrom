// A REPORTED SIZE RANKS; THE COMPANY RECORD DECIDES. A SPENT ALLOWANCE PLANS NOTHING.
//
// Canary 87ecf153 (local, 2026-09-24): company search returned ByteByteGo and
// Psychology Today for an 11–50 mission. The pre-pass excluded both on their
// search-row `employeeCount` (86 and 2,135) — which is LinkedIn ASSOCIATED
// MEMBERS, not staff. Both companies DECLARE 11-50: the search's own
// `companySize: ["11-50"]` filter reads exactly that declared band, which is
// why they were returned at all (companySize.ts).
//
// Replayed here through the real engine with rows shaped like the canary's:
//
//   company search → plausible declared band 11-50 → ranked UP, not excluded
//   → enrichment (one batched company-details read) → PROVEN declared band
//   → size PASS (the member count is shown, never decides) → Atomus target
//
// a company whose record DECLARES a band outside the range still fails and
// buys no Atomus, and with the allowance spent, no discovery planning — this
// slice or the next.
