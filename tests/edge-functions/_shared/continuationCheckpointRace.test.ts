// Production task 85192217-b4c1-40c0-8e4e-9643319935e4, 2026-08-19. The parent
// slice did everything right: discovery returned 100 companies, ~314 open roles
// were evaluated, 1 of 10 qualified, 51 candidates remained on the frontier, and
// it correctly decided to continue.
//
//   11:04:02.981  terminal_status_overridden  round_limit_reached
//                                             -> continuation_required
//   11:04:05.957  auto-continuation           qualified: 1, requested: 10,
//                                             frontier_remaining: 51,
//                                             dispatched: true, handed_off: true
//   11:04:10.591  continuation-restore-empty  expected_companies: 100,
//                                             restored_records: 0
//   11:04:10.712  terminal_guard_disarmed     reason: continuation_restore_empty
//
// The task then sat at `ready` forever with 51 candidates unexamined.
//
// ── WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// NOT the dispatch ordering. The parent already writes its result and releases
// the lease before dispatching; the comment at the dispatch site says so and it
// is true.
//
// NOT the empty-restore guard. Refusing to overwrite 100 companies with 0 is
// correct and must stay correct.
//
// The defect was the successor's FIRST write. `run-agent` persists the paid
// execution preflight early, "before the throw, so a blocked run is still
// auditable" — and it did so as a WHOLESALE REPLACE of `result`. On a
// continuation `task.id` is the PARENT's id, so that write deleted
// `lead_resume_checkpoint` about four seconds before `loadLeadResumeRecords`
// went looking for it. The successor erased its own inheritance.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO Actor runs, ZERO model calls, ZERO database writes.
