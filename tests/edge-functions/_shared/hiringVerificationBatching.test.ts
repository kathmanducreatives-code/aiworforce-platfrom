// ONE QUESTION, ASKED FOR SEVERAL COMPANIES AT A TIME.
//
// `hiring_verification` asked the provider once per company. The Actor accepts
// `company[]` up to 10, so a slice that could afford one paid search answered
// ONE company and left the rest unassessed.
//
// Run 07e973f1, live: eleven companies enriched, ONE hiring call,
// "the eligible set was empty (29 companies carried no hiring assessment)",
// nothing qualified, no canonical event written.
//
// ── THE BATCH SIZE WAS 10, ON A PREMISE THAT MEASUREMENT DISPROVED ─────────
//
// This file used to state that "a call takes ~48s whether it carries one
// company or ten", and 10 followed from it. Task 783fa163 ran the same Actor
// on the same twenty titles twice:
//
//     companies  queries  duration  per query  per company  run
//             1       20     72.0s      3.60s        72.0s  Ot2Jpwe8ezMvbe6Eu
//            10      200    796.4s      3.98s        79.6s  Zs5bYFGlnua1hJWYg
//
// The Actor fans out one query per company×title pair, so duration is LINEAR at
// ~4s a query — the flat-cost premise was simply wrong. Ten companies is ~800s,
// which is 6.4 of the lineage's 10 continuation slices spent watching one call.
//
// So the batch is now DERIVED from that measurement against a wait budget
// (`HIRING_BATCH_WAIT_BUDGET_MS / HIRING_MS_PER_COMPANY`), which is 3. These
// tests assert the derivation and the invariants, not the literal 3 — a future
// re-measurement should move the number without rewriting the file.
//
// THE SEMANTICS DO NOT CHANGE. Same twenty titles, same evidence standard,
// same `freeHiringAssessment` first and paid rows only ever upgrading. What
// changes is how many HTTP calls carry the same question.
//
// Pure. No network, no provider, no model call.
