// Phase 0 measured what a scalar `MissionSignal.type` costs. Three facts reach
// this system in every real B2B request — WHAT happened, TO WHOM, and ABOUT
// WHAT — and one string can hold the first. So:
//
//   "enterprise sales hiring"              -> "hiring"      role gone
//   "leadership posted about US expansion" -> unrecognised, then dropped
//   "US expansion"                         -> "expansion", topic gone, and the
//                                             US booked as a COMPANY location,
//                                             inverting the request
//
// These tests pin the distinctions the descriptor exists to keep. They assert
// SEMANTICS — that two different requirements stay different — never a
// particular regex.
