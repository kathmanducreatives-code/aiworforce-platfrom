// THE EXACT CRASH, END TO END.
//
//   provider started → worker dies → durable checkpoint + run id survive
//   → later claim → same run adopted → working set restored → workflow continues
//
// Every stage below is a real defect this system shipped:
//
//   83d544a5  first slice POSTed a job search, killed mid-poll, wrote NO
//             checkpoint. `claim_sourcing_continuation` refused it —
//             correctly — and 44 paid job rows were stranded for ever.
//   8f59170d  a checkpoint written from `state` alone claimed discovery,
//             identity and enrichment complete while holding ZERO companies.
//             The resume skipped discovery, found nobody to investigate, and
//             burned all ten continuations on four-second barren slices.
//   528c2266  the same divergence from the other side: 100 `company_keys` on
//             the state, 0 companies in the checkpoint, an 83-company frontier
//             destroyed.
//
// Every Actor is a mock. ZERO network, ZERO Actor runs, ZERO model calls.
