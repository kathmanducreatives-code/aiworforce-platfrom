// ONE TRIGGER, ONE GENERATION — WHEN AN ACCEPTANCE RUN ASKS FOR IT.
//
// The 2026-08-30 acceptance run was told to execute exactly one generation. One
// deliberate trigger produced generation 8, which self-dispatched generation 9
// unattended. That is correct product behaviour — "the request continues itself"
// — but it left no way to observe a single slice, and the run had to be stopped
// by marking the live task terminal after the fact.
//
// The flag DEFAULTS OFF and is honoured only for a verified service-role caller,
// because switching off the mechanism that makes a request finish itself is not
// something a browser may ask for.
