// THE REQUEST IS THE JOB. THE INVOCATION IS A SLICE OF IT.
//
// "Find 10 qualified AI startups in the US hiring software engineers" is one
// job. An edge invocation is ~125s of it, which buys roughly ten investigations
// and yields roughly four qualified companies. Reaching ten therefore takes
// three or four slices — and until now the second slice never existed. Across
// 202 sourcing tasks, seventeen checkpoints asked for a continuation and none
// was ever taken, because nothing drove one.
//
// These prove the driver: when it fires, when it must not, what it carries
// between slices, and that a multi-slice run actually reaches the requested
// number without anybody pressing anything.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO Actor runs, ZERO model calls, ZERO database writes.
