// THE FREE PRE-PASS NOW COVERS EVERY SOURCE. THIS IS WHAT HOLDS IT HONEST.
//
// ── WHAT CHANGED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `applyPrequalification` ran behind `if (rawYcRows.length > 0)`. A pool from
// the LinkedIn company search, the funding source or the news source got no
// free triage at all — every company went to identity resolution and enrichment
// (two paid calls, ~26s) before anything decided it was worth keeping, including
// companies whose discovery row ALREADY carried a declared size band outside the
// mission's range.
//
// ── THE TWO WAYS THIS COULD GO WRONG, AND WHAT PINS EACH ───────────────────
//
// TOO EAGER — the pre-pass excludes on a field it should not trust, or on an
// absence, and companies are deleted for free before anything can reconsider.
// This is the worse failure: it is silent, it looks like a small pool, and the
// audit trail shows a company that was never investigated rather than one that
// was rejected. Tests 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 pin it.
//
// TOO CLEVER — the pass grows an `if (actor === …)` and becomes a routing table,
// so a new discovery actor is silently ungated until someone remembers to add a
// branch. Tests 6 and 7 pin that structurally.
//
// EVERY COMPANY BELOW COMES FROM A REAL NORMALIZER, fed the row shape its actor
// really returns. A hand-built `NormalizedHiringCompany` would let a test pass
// against a `field_trust` map that no actor actually declares, which is the one
// thing these assertions must not be able to do.
//
// PURE. No network, provider, model or database access.
