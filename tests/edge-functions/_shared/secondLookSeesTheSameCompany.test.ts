// A SECOND LOOK MUST NOT BE SHOWN A NARROWER COMPANY THAN THE FIRST.
//
// ── THE DEFECT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// P4 runs in `run-agent`, outside the capability walk, and it assembled its own
// registry rather than calling the engine's. The copy was written as:
//
//     buildCompanyEvidence({
//       company: (c?.enriched ?? c?.company)!,
//       company_key: companyKey,
//       identity: c?.identity ?? null,     // declared `identity_state`
//       jobs: c?.hiring_jobs ?? [],        // declared `commercial_jobs`
//     } as never)
//
// `as never` silenced both. Neither field was read, so every re-evaluation in
// every run was handed a company with NO commercial job evidence, NO strongest
// signal, and `identity_state: "not_attempted"` for an identity the first pass
// had verified — plus, from the omitted registry inputs, no funding round, no
// expansion or launch evidence, no provider failures and no employee-count
// alternatives. Nine fields, one cast.
//
// The comment above it claimed the opposite: "the same builder the first pass
// used, so a re-evaluation never sees a narrower company". A comment cannot
// keep two copies of a builder in step. There is now one builder.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO models, ZERO providers, ZERO database.
