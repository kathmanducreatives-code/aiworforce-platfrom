// A TASK RESULT IS ACCUMULATED, NEVER REPLACED.
//
// ── THE SAME BUG, TWICE, IN ONE FILE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `tasks.result` is written by a dozen places in one invocation — the paid
// preflight, stage progress, the capability execution state, the resume
// checkpoint, the evaluation rows, the terminal record. Each is a PART. A
// writer that assigns a fresh object literal deletes everyone else's.
//
//   Run 85192217, 2026-08-19: a continuation's first write replaced the
//   parent's row, destroying `lead_resume_checkpoint` four seconds before the
//   code tried to read it back. Fixed at that ONE site.
//
//   Task ca3d047d, 2026-08-29: the engine discovered 30 companies, resolved 5
//   identities and reached the Company Brain. A second invocation started one
//   second before it finished, took the generic agent path, and its tail wrote
//   `result: { output, tokens_in, tokens_out }` — erasing
//   `capability_execution_state`, `workbench_evaluation_rows`,
//   `mission_funnel`, `lead_resume_checkpoint` and `lead_mission`, including
//   the record of what that continuation had decided. The loss destroyed its
//   own explanation.
//
// The first fix repaired an instance. Five other sites still assigned a bare
// literal. The last test in this file is the one that was missing: it fails on
// the SHAPE, so the sixth site cannot be written.
