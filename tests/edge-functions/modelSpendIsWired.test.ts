// PHASE 6 — THE MODEL LEDGER IS ONLY REAL IF THE PIPELINE IS WIRED TO IT.
//
// ── WHAT WAS OBSERVED ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `recordModelCall`, the `model_call` record kind, its three CHECK constraints
// and `modelCallLedger.test.ts` were all built, shipped and correct. The
// collector was wired into `pilot-chat` — and nowhere else.
//
// In the ten days to 2026-09-04 the ledger held exactly ONE `model_call` row,
// from a `signal_relevance` call on a pilot path, against 1277 provider rows.
// Every lead mission's model spend was unrecorded: triage, evaluation,
// discovery and execution planning, pool and round planning, evidence planning
// and extraction, and the P4 re-evaluation. A run could be audited for Apify
// dollars to the cent and still not answer "what did the models cost?".
//
// ── WHY THIS TEST IS STRUCTURAL ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every unit test of the mechanism passed throughout. They exercised
// `recordModelCall` against a fake writer, which is exactly what stayed
// healthy; what was missing was the ARGUMENT at the call site. A test of the
// mechanism cannot see that, so this one reads the wiring itself.
//
// It is deliberately a whitelist-free scan: it finds every model-backed factory
// `run-agent` constructs and requires the seam on each, so a factory added
// later is covered without anybody remembering to extend a list.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO DB, ZERO model, ZERO spend.
