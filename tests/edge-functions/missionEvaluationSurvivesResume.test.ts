// AN EVALUATION THE RUN PAID FOR MUST SURVIVE THE RESUME BUILT TO PRESERVE IT.
//
// ── THE RUN THIS EXISTS FOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Lineage 57b937ab evaluated thirty-eight companies and qualified none. Not one
// of them failed a requirement — `mission_failed_requirements: []` on every
// row. Two of the strongest:
//
//   DiligenceVault   67 employees   "clearly offers a B2B software platform"
//   FastSpring      188 employees   "SaaS payments platform, Belfast office"
//
// Both came back `held_for_evidence` with `mission_decision: null`,
// `mission_reasoning: null` and `decision_source: "restored_decision"`.
//
// `brain` was checkpointed. `mission_evaluation` was not — it appeared nowhere
// in `leadResumeState.ts`. So a restored company carried the OUTCOME of an
// evaluation with none of its reasoning, and:
//
//   * `buildLeadVerdict` reads `mission_evaluation.icp_fit` → null
//   * `icpVerdictFrom(null, …)` → "insufficient_evidence"
//   * `qualificationDecision` → "ICP fit could not be established"
//
// and because `brain` DID survive, `restoredBrainKeys` short-circuited the
// evaluator before it could run again. Evaluated once, judgement discarded,
// never re-judged, unqualifiable for ever.
//
// ZERO network, ZERO DB, ZERO provider spend.
