// LEAD MISSION WORKER — PURE LIFECYCLE. No Deno, no DB, no network: every effect
// is injected, so the whole claim → heartbeat → run → release cycle is exercised
// in a unit test with zero infrastructure (mirrors the rest of _shared).
//
// WHAT THE WORKER OWNS: the execution LIFECYCLE of one QUEUE ROW — claim it, keep
// its lease (and, once bound, its task and lineage lease) alive while work is in
// flight, run it, release. It owns no quota, no qualification, no evidence and no
// money logic; those stay inside run-agent's handler, which `runMission` calls.
//
// THREE INVARIANTS THIS FILE ENFORCES:
//   1. The lease is renewed CONCURRENTLY while runMission awaits a provider, by a
//      heartbeat that runs independently of anything the run is doing.
//   2. If the heartbeat loses ownership or the mission/lineage is cancelled, the
//      run is signalled — the runner revokes the run's deadline, so no new paid
//      work begins and the engine checkpoints through its existing reserve logic.
//   3. The mission ceiling is NOT a worker kill. It is the run's deadline budget,
//      so the EXISTING deadline machinery stops, checkpoints and ends resumable.
