// LEAD V2 P4.1 — A CANCELLED MISSION ENDS EVERY RECORD, NOT JUST THE QUEUE.
//
// `cancel_lead_mission` sets ONE row: the queue. When the cancellation lands on
// a mission a worker is running, the heartbeat fails, the run aborts, and the
// worker's release reconciles the task, lineage and plan — that path is sound.
//
// The hole is the other one. Canary 3dbcec17 was cancelled 2.8s after its slice
// released, so the row was `resumable` and UNCLAIMED. `claim_next_lead_mission`
// never claims a cancelled row, so no worker would ever release it, and nothing
// ran the reconciliation:
//
//     queue   cancelled          ← the operator's write
//     task    ready              ← still resumable, still offers Continue
//     lineage active
//
// which is exactly the four-records-disagree state `leadMissionTerminal.ts`
// exists to prevent. This module closes it: the same `planTerminalReconciliation`
// the worker uses, applied to cancelled rows nobody will claim.
//
// WHAT DECIDES, AND WHAT WRITES. The decision stays in `leadMissionTerminal.ts`
// — one module, one answer to "what does a terminal mission look like". This
// module is the seam that reads the rows and writes the patch, extracted from
// worker/main.ts (which `Deno.serve`-style entry files make untestable) so the
// rule can be exercised directly.
//
// IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION. `planTerminalReconciliation` returns an empty
// patch when the rows already agree, and an empty patch writes nothing. A
// second cancel, a second sweep and a sweep racing the worker all converge.
//
// NEVER REVIVES. It only ever reads rows for a queue row that is ALREADY
// cancelled, and never widens a terminal status: a completed mission is not a
// cancellation and is never visited.
