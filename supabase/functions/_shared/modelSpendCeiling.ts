// A WORKSPACE CANNOT SPEND WITHOUT LIMIT ON MODELS.
//
// ── THE HOLE THIS CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `toolRegistry` gates exactly two things: `PAID_TOOLS = {source_with_apify,
// scrape_url}`. Those reserve credits, write a ledger row, and settle. Model
// calls do none of it. The lead engine bounds itself per run — `calls_allowed`,
// `MAX_COMPILATION_ATTEMPTS`, the investigation budget — but chat has no
// ceiling of any kind, so a user in a loop is an unbounded bill.
//
// ── WHY NOT CREDITS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious move is `authorizeProviderCall` with a new `model_call` kind. It
// is the wrong instrument. `CREDITS_PER_PROVIDER_CALL = 1`, and lineage
// `ab06540f` made over a hundred model calls against thirty-nine Apify calls —
// so a credit would stop meaning "a paid provider run" and start meaning
// "either a LinkedIn scrape or one sentence of chat", and every existing
// balance would silently revalue. It also needs the `kind` CHECK widened, and
// this file's neighbours record two separate outages caused by sending a value
// a CHECK did not permit.
//
// Models are priced per token, not per call, and `lead_model_calls` already
// carries `workspace_id`, `estimated_cost_usd`, `actual_cost_usd` and
// `cost_source` for every call the lead engine makes. The ceiling is therefore
// a SUM OVER MONEY ALREADY RECORDED, which is also the shape `monitoring_
// budgets` uses (`period_ceiling` + `period_days`) for the same problem.
//
// ── A CEILING OVER UNRECORDED SPEND IS THEATRE ─────────────────────────────
//
// This only works on calls that reach `lead_model_calls`. 255 of the 256 rows
// there belong to the lead engine; chat writes to `activity_feed` with no token
// counts and no cost at all. So capture comes first and enforcement second, and
// `unpriced_calls` below exists to make the remaining blind spot loud instead
// of letting it read as $0.00 and a clean bill of health.
