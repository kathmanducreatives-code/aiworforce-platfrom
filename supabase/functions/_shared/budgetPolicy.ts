// Now every call is ESTIMATED from its spec (the exact input it will send),
// RESERVED against absolute call / candidate / route / mission ceilings before
// the network call, marked EXECUTED with a provisional cost, and SETTLED from
// the provider's receipt when it is available. A call that would breach any
// ceiling is `refused_budget` and never runs. Unused budget stays unused — no
// percentage split (plan, "Cost and Idempotency").
