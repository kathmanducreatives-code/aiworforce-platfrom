// PAID PROVIDER WORK NEEDS AUTHORIZATION, AND A WARNING IS NOT AUTHORIZATION.
//
// ── WHAT THE AUDIT FOUND ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The credit ledger is not missing. `credits_reserve`, `credits_finalize`,
// `credits_release_stale` and `credits_grant` have existed since 2026-08-07 and
// are correct: idempotency is checked BEFORE money moves, concurrency is
// controlled by a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE balance_credits >= p_amount`
// whose own comment reads "there is no window in which both observe the same
// balance", finalize is row-locked and replay-safe and can never charge more
// than was reserved, and a reaper releases reservations orphaned by a crash.
//
// Exactly one edge function calls any of it: `unlock-founders`. The lead path —
// orchestrate → run-agent → the capability engine → Apify — never touches it.
// `src/lib/credits/ledger.ts` is consumed only by React components: it
// displays, it does not enforce. That is why the UI can say "0 credits left"
// while a run spends real money, and why `credit_transactions` holds zero rows
// and `workspace_credit_balances` holds none at all.
//
// So this module does not design a credit system. It routes provider execution
// through the one that already exists.
//
// ── WHERE THIS SITS, AND WHY THERE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// At the PHYSICAL call, in `runTool`, beside the ledger write — not at the
// planning layer. A future code path that reaches a provider without knowing
// about credits is the failure mode being designed out, and the only defence
// against it is that the money boundary and the call boundary are the same
// line of code.
//
// ── RESERVE, THEN SETTLE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One credit per paid provider call, reserved before the call and settled
// after. Credits stay an INTERNAL unit — dollars live in the execution ledger
// with their own provenance, and the two are never converted into each other.
//
// Settling matters even at one credit: a call that never started refunds, so a
// run that is refused or dies before dispatch does not quietly consume the
// balance it never used.
//
// The idempotency key is `logical_call_key`, which the ledger already computes
// and already treats as the identity of a call. A retried or replayed call
// therefore reserves nothing further — the RPC returns the original
// transaction — which is what makes continuation and retry safe here.

 * call proceed. It is not a bypass switch bolted beside the real path — it is
 * the real path with the last step disarmed, so what is proved in observe mode
 * is the thing that will run in enforce mode.
 *
 * DEFAULT IS `observe`, deliberately. `workspace_credit_balances` is empty, so
 * flipping this on without a grant first would refuse every provider call in
