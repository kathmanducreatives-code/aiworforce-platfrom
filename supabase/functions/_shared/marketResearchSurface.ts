// A QUESTION ABOUT A MARKET, NOT ABOUT A COMPANY.
//
// ── WHAT THE VOCABULARY WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// "What's happening in the AI recruiting space?" names no company and no page.
// It is `research` — a fresh look — but its subject is a category, a topic, a
// problem space. `REQUEST_ENTITIES` had no word for that, so the request had
// nowhere to land except the lead pipeline, which would have tried to find
// companies matching a topic nobody asked to source.
//
// The word already existed elsewhere in this codebase: `signal_events.subject_type`
// is `competitor | company | market`, and `market` is documented there as "a
// category, topic or problem space rather than an organisation". The semantic
// vocabulary was simply describing less than the persisted one. Adding it aligns
// the two rather than inventing a third.
//
// ── AND WHY AVAILABILITY IS ASKED, NOT INFERRED ────────────────────────────
//
// pilot-chat decided this surface was degraded by testing
// `!decision.selected_actor_key` — a field the classifier deliberately left
// unset so that `validateAgainstCapabilities` could clear or fill it. Three
// components had to agree on the meaning of one null for the user to get an
// honest answer, and the question underneath it was never semantic at all: is
// web search configured in this deployment?
//
// `webSearchAvailable` asks that directly. It is the single definition — the
// validator imports it rather than keeping its own copy — so the answer cannot
// differ between the component that decides and the component that explains.
//
// Pure apart from the env reader, which is injected.
