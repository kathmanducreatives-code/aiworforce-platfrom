// WHAT A SIGNAL ACTUALLY IS — an event, about a subject, with qualifiers.
//
// ── WHY A SCALAR TYPE WAS NEVER ENOUGH ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `MissionSignal.type` is one string, and the Phase 0 audit measured what that
// costs. Three separate facts reach this system in every real B2B request:
//
//   WHAT HAPPENED   a post, a funding round, an open role
//   TO WHOM         the company itself, or a named leader at it
//   ABOUT WHAT      US expansion, enterprise sales, a Series B
//
// A scalar can hold the first and drops the other two. So:
//
//   "enterprise sales hiring"              -> "hiring"      (role gone)
//   "leadership posted about US expansion" -> "leadership posts", unrecognised
//   "US expansion"                         -> "expansion"   (topic gone, and the
//                                             deterministic reader booked
//                                             "United States" as a company
//                                             GEOGRAPHY, inverting the meaning)
//
// The role survived only through a parallel channel — `role_families` plus
// `required_signal_terms` — which exists for roles and nothing else. There was
// no channel at all for a topic, for the subject of a post, or for the
// difference between a company posting and its CEO posting.
//
// ── WHAT THIS MODULE IS AND IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It is the REQUIREMENT vocabulary: what the user asked to be proven. It is not
// `signalEvent.ts`, which is the persisted signals-v2 record of something that
// was observed, with provenance and verification. One is a question, the other
// is an answer, and they are deliberately separate types.
//
// Nothing here selects an Actor, names a provider, or decides whether a signal
// can be served. That is `actorEvidenceCapability`'s job, and keeping the two
// apart is what stops a requirement vocabulary quietly becoming a routing table.
//
// PURE. No network, provider, model or database access.
