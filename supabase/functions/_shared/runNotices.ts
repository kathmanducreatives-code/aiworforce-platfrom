// THE CHAT'S ACCOUNT OF A RUN FOLLOWS THE LINEAGE, NOT THE FIRST SLICE.
//
// Canary 11 (plan 76194e61, 2026-09-25), as the conversation read afterwards:
//
//   14:26:08  "This run reached its time limit partway through…"   PARTIALLY_SATISFIED
//   14:30:07  "I opened the results in Workbench — 0 of 1…"        continuation_required
//   14:38:48  (the lineage ends search_exhausted — nothing is written)
//
// Nothing had timed out. The first notice was written at the first STAGE
// BOUNDARY (`onCheckpoint` saves progress at every one), 34 seconds in; the
// second by the first slice, which ended at a designed slice boundary. The
// results message is one-per-plan, so the slice that actually finished found it
// already there and said nothing. Chat showed a failure, Pilot read one from the
// history, and the Workbench — whose run status comes from that message's
// `ui_panel` snapshot — stayed on "Round complete".
//
// THE RULE:
//
//   a stage boundary or a slice boundary  → a NEUTRAL "continuing" notice
//   a continuation                        → the same notices, updated in place
//   the lineage ends                      → the results message becomes FINAL,
//                                           and the checkpoint notice is resolved
//                                           into a neutral historical line
//
// A final notice is never reopened, and no notice ever states an outcome the
// lineage has not reached. The canonical status stays on the task, the lineage
// and the plan; these messages only report it.
//
// Pure decisions, plus I/O through `NoticeDb` so the whole lifecycle is testable
// without a database.
