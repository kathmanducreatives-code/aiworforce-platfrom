// ONE TERMINAL TRANSITION FOR A LEAD V2 MISSION.
//
// Run 4250f181 ended as

//   queue   failed                     (5 of 5 attempts)
//   task    ready / continuation_required
//   lineage active
//   plan    partial
//
// — four records, three different answers to "is this mission over?", and a UI
// that still offered Continue on a mission nothing would ever run again. The
// queue decided the mission was finished and nobody told the other three.
//
// THE RULE. Once the queue is terminal, every record is:
//
//   queue      complete            failed / cancelled
//   task       not resumable       status `failed`, terminal_status != continuation_required
//   lineage    terminal            terminal (cancelled for a cancellation)
//   plan       complete | partial  failed
//
// PURE. The worker reads the rows, asks this module what to write, and writes
// it. Idempotent: consistent rows produce no writes.
