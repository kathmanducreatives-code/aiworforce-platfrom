// THE PRODUCTION EDGE FOR MISSION TRIAGE.
//
// Same shape as `missionEvaluationBinding` and `semanticClassificationBinding`,
// deliberately: one pattern for "a model call the pipeline may make", so there
// is one place to look for whether a stage is live and one place it can be
// switched off.
//
// ── SAFETY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   * OFF by default. BOTH the flag AND the workspace allow-list must pass; an
//     empty allow-list enables nobody, so there is no single global switch.
//   * NO ESCALATION. Triage is a cheap, high-volume pass and never justifies the
//     escalation tier.
//   * BOUNDED BY BATCHES, not by companies. A hundred candidates cost four calls.
//   * DISABLED IS NOT EXCLUDED. With the flag off no call is made and every
//     company keeps the deterministic prequalification verdict it already had —
//     the previous behaviour exactly, not a pool of silent rejections.
//   * A FAILED BATCH IS UNCERTAIN, NEVER IRRELEVANT. Nothing a model failure
//     does may remove a company from the run.
//
// Pure apart from the injected facade. No provider import, no network.

  // Triage is the most frequent model call the pipeline makes — one per 25
  // companies, on every run — and the least consequential per call. It answers
  // "plausibly worth paying to investigate?", and its own failure mode is
  // already safe: anything it cannot decide becomes `uncertain`, which costs a
  // company its PRIORITY and never its place in the run. A wrong answer here
  // reorders a shortlist; a wrong answer in strategy or qualification
  // misdirects the whole run or qualifies a company on bad evidence.
  //
  // So this is the one stage that is explicitly downgraded, and the reason
  // travels with every call into the task record.
  // THE ROUTER DECIDES, NOT THIS FILE.
  //
  // This file named its own tier with its own prose reason, which was correct
  // and was also a CONSTANT — so it could not tell twenty-five companies being
  // sorted from four companies each deciding a lead. `routeModel` sees the run,
  // and escalates this stage when the pool stops being much larger than the
  // quota.
