// THE PRODUCTION EDGE FOR SEMANTIC COMPANY CLASSIFICATION.
//
// Everything beneath this file was already built and tested: the gate, the
// budget, the cache, the deterministic validation and the Brain handoff. What was
// missing was the one call-site decision — which model, and how many calls a task
// may pay for. This module makes that decision explicit, gated and observable.
//
// ── WHY A SEPARATE MODULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `run-agent` is capped at TWO kernel imports by `intelligenceFlags` test 32.E,
// and this binding needs the strategist facade, the flag pair, the model id and
// the allowance. Assembling it here keeps run-agent's kernel surface unchanged —
// the same reason the plan-aware budget is assembled behind its own binding.
//
// ── SAFETY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   * OFF by default. BOTH the flag AND the workspace allow-list must pass; an
//     empty allow-list enables nobody, so there is no single global switch.
//   * NO ESCALATION. `allowEscalation: false` — a per-company classification is
//     never worth a second, more expensive model call. That is a strategy-level
//     tool, not a per-row one.
//   * The classifier NEVER decides. It returns evidence; the Company Brain
//     qualifies. A failure yields unknown/evidence_pending, never a rejection.
//   * No credential is read here, and nothing about this reaches the frontend.
//
// Pure apart from the injected facade. No provider import, no network.
