// FREE PREQUALIFICATION — decide who is worth paying for, before paying.
//
// TEST task c8a6e53d-c227-4405-9fcc-e0791b03a4ec discovered 25 YC companies for
// one memo23 run, then issued ONE paid Actor start per company to resolve a
// LinkedIn identity — 16 runs, every one returning zero rows, until the edge
// function hit its wall clock and the plan hung in Running forever.
//
// Two things were wrong. The lookup used an ENRICHMENT actor as a search index
// (`harvestapi/linkedin-company` with `searches: ["Scale AI"]` returns nothing).
// And it paid to identify companies nobody had yet decided were worth
// identifying.
//
// memo23 already returns everything needed to make that decision for free:
// every company's FULL `openJobs` array, team size, batch, industries and
// one-liner. This module reads that payload and ranks companies by COMMERCIAL
// EXPANSION strength, so the paid LinkedIn stage only ever runs for a bounded
// shortlist.
//
// WHY TIERS RATHER THAN A KEYWORD MATCH. "Senior Software Engineer" and "Head of
// Sales" are both hiring. Only one of them means a company is building a
// go-to-market motion, which is what this mission is actually looking for. A
// flat keyword list cannot express that, and the previous code did not try —
// it displayed `openJobs[0]`, which for a YC startup is almost always an
// engineer.
//
// PURE. No network, provider, model or database access.
