// LEAD V2 P5 PHASE C — THE PAGES WE BOUGHT MUST RESOLVE THE CLAIM WE BOUGHT THEM FOR.
//
// Canary c5e281c9 fetched Dioptra's /product, /customers and /pricing, stored
// them, spent $0.0256 — and still reported `business_model` PENDING with "the
// quote does not state saas delivery". The pages reached only the legacy
// mission re-evaluation. The canonical claim was decided once, during
// qualification, from the registry as it stood BEFORE those pages existed, and
// nothing ever asked the grounder to read them.
//
// So the route that the evidence-gap router exists to choose could never close
// the gap it was chosen for, `with_executable_route` stayed 0, and continuation
// — correctly, given its inputs — widened discovery instead. Four more
// job-search pages, five slices, nothing qualified.
//
// This module is the missing executor:
//
//   pending claim → pages → rebuild registry → re-ground → re-decide → item
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT DO.
//
//   * It never re-grounds a claim that is not pending. A PASS or a verified
//     FAIL is an answer; re-reading it would only risk unsettling it.
//   * It never re-grounds on evidence the current reading already saw. Same
//     pages ⇒ same answer, so the model call is skipped, not spent.
//   * It never decides anything itself. The grounder reads, `businessModelDecision`
//     judges, and the engine's `applyRegroundedVerification` writes.
//   * It never throws into the run. A failed re-grounding leaves the claim
//     exactly as pending as it was.
//
// Deps are injected, so this is testable without a provider, a model or a
// database.
