// THE LEAD WORKFLOW'S ONLY MODEL. GPT, with no fallback.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT `aiProvider.ts` ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `aiProvider` is shared product infrastructure: pilot chat, orchestration,
// intent routing, workflow classification, Company Brain generation, the daily
// brief and the Workbench opener all call it, and it fans out across a Gemini
// gateway and Anthropic with automatic fallback between them. That fallback is
// correct for a chat reply — a slightly different model still answers the user.
//
// It is wrong for this workflow. Lead sourcing spends money on the strength of
// what the model decides: which Actors run, what JSON they receive, whether a
// company's evidence qualifies it. A silent degradation to a different model
// mid-run changes those decisions and leaves no trace in the result, and the
// user's bill is already paid by the time anyone notices.
//
// So the lead path imports this module and never `aiProvider`. GPT answers, or
// the stage fails and says so. A wrong actor selection is recoverable; an
// invisible one is not.
//
// ── AND WHY IT DOES NOT RETRY ACROSS MODELS ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `aiProvider` tries Gemini, then a second Gemini model, then Anthropic. On the
// migrated project `LOVABLE_API_KEY` is a placeholder, so every one of its calls
// currently burns two failed authentications before reaching a working provider.
// That is invisible latency against an edge-function wall clock. This module has
// one credential and one endpoint: if it fails, the caller learns immediately.
//
// PURE OF SECRETS. The key is read from the environment at call time and never
// returned, logged, or included in an error — an error path that echoes its own
// credential is how keys reach log aggregators.

 * Every intelligence stage ran on `gpt-4.1`, because one constant named the

 * twenty-five companies and answers "plausibly worth paying for?" — a
 * high-volume, low-stakes classification, and the single most frequent call the
 * pipeline makes. Interpreting an ambiguous mission, choosing a multi-actor
 * strategy or qualifying a company on cited evidence are none of those things.
 * Paying the same rate for both is not a safety property, it is an absence of a
 * decision.
 *
 * TWO TIERS, NOT A CONTINUUM. A knob with five settings invites tuning; a
 * binary invites a judgement about the work, which is the thing that actually
 * needs making. The rule:
 *
 *   reasoning  a wrong answer misdirects the run or spends money badly —
 *              mission interpretation, strategy, actor selection,
 *              qualification, ranking, re-planning
 *   fast       a wrong answer costs one row its ORDER and nothing else —
 *              triage, extraction, normalisation, classification
 *
 * THE DEFAULT IS `reasoning`. A caller that has not thought about which tier it
 * needs gets the one that cannot quietly degrade a decision; downgrading is
