// A GENERATION MAY ADD TO WHAT THE LINEAGE KNOWS. IT MAY NOT SUBTRACT.
//
// ── WHAT LAST-WRITER-WINS COST, ON 2026-08-30 ──────────────────────────────
//
// Lineage 862e81be, live, with the lease enforced. Generation 2 (task 66ef37b7)
// bought a job search and recorded three companies:
//
//   Storm4 / Talentoma / Storm3   verified_externally, external_job_search
//
// `resume-stalled-leads` then resumed the ORPHANED generation-1 task, which had
// been killed before it ever saw that evidence. It read its own task row, found
// nothing verified, and released last:
//
//   Storm4 / Talentoma / Storm3   not_verified, evidence_source: none
//
// `not_verified` is terminal, so all three became companies nothing would ever
// revisit, and the evidence they were bought with was stranded on a task row
// that nothing reads.
//
// ── WHY THE COMPARE-AND-SWAP DID NOT STOP IT ───────────────────────────────
//
// `release_lineage_lease` refuses a write whose `expected_version` is stale. The
// stale generation's version was NOT stale: the sweeper started it after
// generation 2 had already committed, so it acquired the lease, read version 1,
// and quoted 1 back. The lease and the CAS serialise writers. Serialising a
// writer that carries old CONTENT still loses the newer content — order is not
// monotonicity, and nothing in the schema said so.
//
// ── THE RULE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two clauses, and the second is the one that matters:
//
//   1. SETTLED BEATS UNSETTLED. A stage that owes no further work may not be
//      replaced by one that does. "Owes work" is decided by the same predicates
//      `nextStageFor` routes on, so the merge and the resume cannot disagree
//      about whether a company is finished.
//
//   2. CITED BEATS UNCITED. Both `verified_externally` and `not_verified` are
//      settled, so clause 1 alone would have permitted the whole regression. A
//      verdict that cites evidence outranks one that cites none.
//
// Clause 2 is deliberately narrow, and matches the guard Phase 3 put in the
// assessor: a pass that DID inspect evidence may still change the answer. Only
// an EVIDENCE-FREE verdict is refused. Protecting a citation from a better
// citation would be its own defect.
//
// Pure. No I/O.
