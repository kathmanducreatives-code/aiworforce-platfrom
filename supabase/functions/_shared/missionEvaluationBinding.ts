// THE PRODUCTION EDGE FOR MISSION EVALUATION.
//
// `missionEvaluation` is pure and decides nothing about who may run it, on
// whose behalf, with which model, or how many times. This module makes that
// one call-site decision explicit, gated and observable — the same shape as
// `semanticClassificationBinding` and `groundedBrainBinding`, deliberately, so
// there is one pattern for "a model call the pipeline may make" rather than
// three.
//
// ── SAFETY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   * OFF by default. BOTH the flag AND the workspace allow-list must pass; an
//     empty allow-list enables nobody, so there is no single global switch.
//   * NO ESCALATION. `allowEscalation: false` — a per-company evaluation never
//     justifies the escalation tier.
//   * BOUNDED. One call per company, capped at the shortlist size. There is no
//     retry loop here: a failure returns null and the caller records
//     `insufficient_evidence`, which is never a silent qualify.
//   * DISABLED IS NOT REJECTED. With the flag off the pipeline makes no model
//     call and every company is reported `not_evaluated` — visibly, in the
//     telemetry — rather than being quietly failed by deterministic code.
//   * No credential is read here, and no provider name is ever sent.
//
// Pure apart from the injected facade. No provider import, no network.
