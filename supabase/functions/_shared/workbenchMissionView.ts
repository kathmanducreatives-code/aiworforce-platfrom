// LEAD V2 P5 — ONE PROJECTION OWNS EVERY NUMBER.
//
// The Workbench read three independent count sources — `progress`, the
// portfolio and the evaluation rows — and they disagreed, so a run could show
// "10 discovered" beside "0 evaluated · 3 qualified" and no row explained the
// other seven. The plan's answer is one view: each discovered company lands in
// EXACTLY ONE bucket, and the buckets sum to `discovered` by construction.
//
//   discovered
//     ├── screened_out          the cheap gate ruled it out before paid work
//     ├── identity_unresolved   nothing could say which company it is
//     ├── investigating         still being worked; no eligibility yet
//     ├── ineligible            a hard criterion is disproven (a disposition)
//     ├── pending               a hard criterion is unknown — "needs verification"
//     └── exact_match · strong_opportunity · worth_considering · low_priority
//
// The label buckets hold only ELIGIBLE candidates, and the order above is the
// order the bucket is chosen in, so a company cannot be counted twice.
//
// `legacyCountsFrom` derives the old keys from this same view — the migration
// contract: the legacy surfaces keep working, but they stop being a second
// source of truth.
