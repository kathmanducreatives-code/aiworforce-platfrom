 * WHY IT IS ITS OWN NUMBER. The 18s above is sized for the slowest downstream

 * engine authorise a call it cannot complete". That argument does not apply to
 * qualification: its model calls are already hard-bounded by the engine's
 * `clockBound`, which caps each one at `remaining − reserve`, so a
 * qualification call physically cannot run into the reserve. And a company the
 * clock stops mid-flight is NOT REACHED — no verdict, no rejection, still
 * resumable. Borrowing the provider reserve here bought safety that was
 * already guaranteed, and paid for it in leads.
 *
 * WHAT IT COST. TEST run b7a9e112 stopped qualification three times:
 *
 *     evaluated: 1, not_reached: 2, remaining_ms: 22206
 *     evaluated: 1, not_reached: 6, remaining_ms: 22984
 *     evaluated: 2, not_reached: 2, remaining_ms: 23658
 *
 * Admission needs `reserve + estimate` — 18,000 + 7,000 = 25,000 — so every one
 * fell one to three seconds short and left between two and six ALREADY ENRICHED
 * companies without a verdict. Run 9b5ad99b lost all four of its at 19,137ms.
 *
 * WHY 14 SECONDS. Measured, not chosen. The work that actually happens after
 * qualification stops — persistence, the quota pass, auto-continuation dispatch
 * and the terminal guard — across five slices on three builds:
 *
 *     5.96s   6.27s   7.80s   7.86s   9.38s
 *
 * 14s clears all three admissions above (needing 21,000 against 22.2–23.7s
 * available) and keeps 4.6s of margin over the worst tail ever observed. A
 * smaller reserve would admit no more companies than this one does — after one
 * ~7s evaluation the remaining clock is ~15s, below every candidate threshold —
 * so 14s is the LARGEST value that unblocks, which is the one to pick.

   * whether anything remains that could widen the pool. No company carries
   * that, and a slice that has to re-derive it re-derives it wrong — it would
   * restart a paginating source at page one.
   *
   * Restarting page one is cheap in money and expensive in time: the identical
   * input hashes to the identical `logical_call_key`, so the completed run is
   * ADOPTED rather than re-bought, and the slice spends its budget re-reading
   * rows it already holds instead of finding new ones.
   *
   * Optional, like every field added here after the fact. A checkpoint written
   * before this existed has none, and the reader narrows absence to "discovery
   * state unknown" — which `decideAutoContinuation` treats as "no routes
   * remain", the behaviour those runs already had.

 * and simply did not mention `snapshot`, so every one was dropped on load.

 * frontier read empty, the yield gate answered `frontier_exhausted`, and runs
 * reported "every discovered candidate has been investigated" with 88 of 98
 * never touched — while the auto-continuation message promised the user it was
 * "looking for 8 more across 87 remaining companies". Three consecutive TEST
 * runs ended that way. The continuation machinery was complete except for this.

 * deploy wrote. Only the SHAPE is checked; `restoreWorkingSet` owns the value
 * narrowing (investigation state, enrichment outcome, rank) and already treats
 * every field as untrusted. A snapshot with no `company` object cannot rebuild
 * anything, so it reads as absent rather than as an empty company — which keeps
