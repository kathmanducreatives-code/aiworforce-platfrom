// THE SWEEPER THE CONTINUATION PATH ALWAYS ASSUMED EXISTED.
//
// `leadContinuationDispatch` fires the next slice in process and documents the
// trade: "a slice which dies between writing its checkpoint and firing the next
// one stalls the chain… the existing claim/lease means a sweeper (or a user
// pressing Continue) can pick it up later without racing anything." This is
// that sweeper.
//
// ── A SCHEDULER ENTRY POINT, AND NOTHING ELSE ──────────────────────────────
//
// Modelled on `run-monitoring-tick`, for the same reason it gives: a scheduled
// resume and a manual one must be the SAME resume, or the thing that runs
// unattended is not the thing anybody tested. So this owns no provider, no
// engine, no mission and no writer. It selects, and it calls `run-agent` —
// the endpoint the in-process handoff and the Continue button both call.
//
// ── AND IT INVENTS NO LOCK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Mutual exclusion is `claim_sourcing_continuation`, which `run-agent` already
// takes on every resume: `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, a lease with an expiry, a
// terminal check and an optimistic `checkpoint_version`. Two sweepers racing
// the same task produce one claim and one 409 — and the 409 is a correct,
// quiet outcome here, not an error.
//
// Spend is bounded by the ceilings that already bound it: `continuations_used`,
// `cost_units_used`, and the credit authorisation at the provider boundary.
// `eligibleForAutoResume` reads them rather than adding any of its own.

 * is drawn from the row's own persisted counters — barren slices, continuations
 * used, cost units used, the restorability of its own checkpoint — so this
 * writes down a conclusion the row already contained and nobody had read.
 *
 * `already_terminal` is deliberately NOT a terminate verdict: something else
 * gave that row its status, and overwriting it would be exactly the
 * overreach this comment exists to rule out.
 *
 * THE SAVED STATE IS KEPT. Terminating means "this will not resume itself",
 * never "this is deleted". The checkpoint stays in `result`, the lineage row
 * keeps its `current_state`, and a person may still pick it up deliberately.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: a sweeper that can fail a tick because a message
 * insert failed is worse than one that occasionally reports less.
